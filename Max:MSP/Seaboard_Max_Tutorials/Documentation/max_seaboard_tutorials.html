<h3>Max Seaboard Tutorials</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>In this folder you will fine 7 Max MSP tutorial patches that explain how the MIDI data from the Seaboard can be inputted into Max and then used to control monophonic and polyphonic synthesisers. These patches also show how polyphonic pitch bend and aftertouch can be set-up in Max and how all this information can be outputted to external applications with the use of OSC (Open Sound Control).</p>

<p>Before opening any of these Patches, please make sure the Seaboard is connected to your computer and is powered up. When first powering up the Seaboard you will need to wait for around 15 seconds for it to boot up.</p>

<p>Each patch will open in Presentation Mode, demoing clearly the finished patch. To expand each patch and to see how each one was created, please click out of presentation mode.</p>

<p>Inside each patch you will find comments documenting how and why each object was used, helping you to learn how you can use the same techniques to create your own patches using the Seaboard</p>

<p>Tutorial 7- <a href="">Outputting MIDI data from the Seaboard using OSC</a></p>

<h4>Tutorial 1- Inputting MIDI data from the Seaboard</h4>

<p>This patch shows how to select the Seaboard as a MIDI input device and how to input MIDI data from it into a Max patch using the ‘midiparse' object. This object will allow to input MIDI pitch and velocity data, polyphonic aftertouch and the MIDI channel being used.</p>

<h1><img src="Tutorial_1a.png" alt="Tutorial 1a" /></h1>

<p>Instead of using the  ‘midiparse’ object for Pitch Bend, the ‘xbendin’ object is used to be able to easily input 14 bit Pitch Bend from the Seaboard.</p>

<h1><img src="Tutorial_1b.png" alt="Tutorial 1b" /></h1>

<p>From this patch it can be seen that Polyphonic aftertouch is inputted my the continuous pressure put on each note played. Pitch Bend is applied to the bend of notes on the X-axis and then sliding of notes with the use of the Glissando Ribbon at the top and the bottom of the Seaboard. If you perform a Pitch Bend on one of the ribbons, you will notice that the14-bit pitch bend applies to a range of +/- 1 octaves.</p>

<h4>Tutorial 2- Separating MIDI data per channel from the Seaboard</h4>

<p>This patch shows how the data from the Seaboard can be split into individual channels for each note played. By playing multi notes it can be seen that Aftertouch and Pitch Bend are polyphonic and apply individually for each note. To achieve this you can see that each note played is on a different MIDI channel, using up to 10 channels.</p>

<h4>Tutorial 3- Monophonic Sine Wave Synthesiser using the Seaboard</h4>

<p>This patch shows how a simple monophonic sine synthesiser being controlled be the Seaboard, can be created in Max. To trigger notes on and off, the velocity of each note determines the amplitude of the signal and a note off message of a velocity value of 0, mutes the signal. To avoid any clicks when a note is released, a ‘line~’ object is added to ramp down the velocity to 0 over 20ms. In a more advanced synth patch, this could be replaced with an amplitude envelope that would give more control over the the amplitude of a note while it is played and when it is released.</p>

<h1><img src="Tutorial_3.png" alt="Tutorial 3" /></h1>

<p>Continuous Aftertouch is applied to the amplitude of each note, varying the level of a note played, after the initial velocity value.</p>

<p>Pitch Bend is then applied to vary the frequency of the Oscillator by +/- 1 Octave. This is achieved by compressing the 14-bit pitch  bend from -8192 to +8191 to -1 to +1. The formula of;</p>

<p>base frequency x 2^(pitch bend)</p>

<p>is then used so that it will double the base frequency for a +1 octave pitch bend and half the frequency for a -1 octave pitch bend.</p>

<h4>Tutorial 4- Polyphonic Sine Wave Synthesiser using the Seaboard</h4>

<p>The simple sine synth created in the previous patch is now encapsulated into a ‘poly~’ object to allow multiple instance of the patch to be used simultaneously, introducing polyphony. As the Seaboard uses up to 10 MIDI channels, 10 voices/ instances of the original sine synth are created.</p>

<h1><img src="Tutorial_4.png" alt="Tutorial 4" /></h1>

<p>To also create polyphonic Aftertouch and Pitch Bend, each voice/ instance needs to input note data, aftertouch and pitch bend for a specific MIDI channel. For instance, pitch bend, aftertouch and note data on MIDI channel 1 will only go to the first voice/ instance of the Sine_synth patch. To achieve this, the message ‘target $1’ is sent to the first inlet of the ‘poly~’ object, where $1 will be replaced by the current MIDI channel data is being sent on.</p>

<h4>Tutorial 5- Monophonic FM Synthesiser using the Seaboard</h4>

<p>This patch shows how a simple monophonic FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesiser controlled by the Seaboard, can be created in Max.</p>

<h1><img src="Tutorial_5.png" alt="Tutorial 5" /></h1>

<p>As before with the sine wave synth, pitch bend is set to modulate the pitch of the oscillator by +/- 1 octave. Aftertouch however is no longer assigned to the amplitude of the note played but instead, controls the Modulation Depth of the Modulating frequency. This changes the timbre of the sound created, and works well at creating a pseudo frequency cut-off, where adding more pressure opens up the filter further.</p>

<p>There is also control over the Harmonic ratio, or the Scale between the Carrier and Modulation frequency. Having the value of the scale as an integer value will create a consonant sound, while having the value in-between integers will create more of a dissonant sound.</p>

<h4>Tutorial 6- Polyphonic FM Synthesiser using the Seaboard</h4>

<p>The FM patch created in the previous tutorial is now encapsulated into a ‘poly~’ object similar to Tutorial 4, creating a 10 voice Polyphonic FM Synthesiser, with full polyphonic Aftertouch and Pitch Bend from the Seaboard.</p>

<p>The difference with this patch is that there is an extra parameter added that controls the Scale between the Carrier and Modulating frequency. As this is a parameter that is local to all instances, every time this value changes, a message of ‘target 0’ needs to be sent to the left inlet of the poly~ object to update all instances. If this is not there then, it will only update the current instance being used.</p>

<h1><img src="Tutorial_6.png" alt="Tutorial 6" /></h1>

<p>This is something to consider when designing your own polyphonic synths, as this is needed if you want to have control of parameters over all instances, such as envelopes or oscillator types.</p>

<h4>Tutorial 7- Outputting MIDI data from the Seaboard using OSC</h4>

<p>This patch shows how the ‘udpsend’ object can be used to output any data from Max to external applications with the use of Open Sound Control (OSC). When using OSC, the IP address of the receiving application or device needs to be set, as well as the port it is going to be send to. This can be manually updated in this patch using the text boxes provided.</p>
